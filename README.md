This program is run using python
The file names in the program will need to be changed to your own file name, i used a standard txt file for input.
Currently this program uses -0, 00, 01, 02..., 36 as possible choices, each number is 2 digits long and with 00 already taken -0 is used to represent 0.
This program also uses both numpy and xlswriter which will need to be downloaded seperately from a licensed vendor to use.
Included are the 2 data sets I used named test1 and test2 also included are the results in excel form named data1 and data2
